# Drone Operator Dashboard
This dashboard is capable of rendering real-time coordinates of drones along with a timestamp of when the coordinates were produced to the Apache Kafka pipeline.

## Apache Kafka Producer (Python Script)
Messages are produced by executing `drone_location_producer.py`, which parses the JSON files found in `./tempDroneData`. The content in these files were generated by drawing routes on geojson.io.

After parsing the files and extracting the coordinates, a loop infinitely produces a new message every half-second to the `droneBusData` Kafka topic created locally.

This file could later be a Flask app itself that connects to the Raspberry Pi chips and generates its messages from there instead of the JSON files.

## Apache Kafka Consumer (Flask App)
On initialization, the consumer app sets up a web socket to emit Kakfa messages to the React app.

The `sendMessage` function with a SocketIO annotation runs every time the equivalent `socketIO.on()` method gets called in React.

## React App
All relevant state variables for now are stored in `DashParent.js` and passed as props to the map and table components accordingly. Putting all this processing power in the parent component takes a toll on the front-end performance, and these socket tasks can be delegated to subcomponents later on to make it run smoothly. 

Since the `useEffect` hook merges the previous functionality of `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, a counter state variable was made to always make sure another SocketIO call is made, even if drone data values don't change between two calls.

## Reproducing the Current Functionality
1. Open CMD and go the path where you put the Kafka folder. Then get zookeeper up and running with `./bin/windows/zookeeper-server-start.bat ../../config/zookeeper.properties`

2. Open a new CMD, go to the same path and get the Kafak server running with `kafka-server-start.bat ../../config/server.properties`

3. Open new CMD -> same path, then create a topic called `droneBusData` with the command `kafka-topics.bat --zookeeper 0.0.0.0:2181 --topic droneBusData --create --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`

4. Start the React development server (can be done at any point)

5. Open another CMD and run `drone_location_producer.py`

6. Start `consumer_app.py` Flask app. Leave it on localhost:5000 to avoid having to change any code. Open a browser window at localhost:5000 as well.
